## Docker run

```bash
docker run --interactive --tty alpine:3.10 # or, to be shorter: docker run -it alpine:3.10
```

The `run` part of the command is telling Docker you're going to be executing a container (as opposed to building it.)

The `-it` part says you want to be dropped into the container interactively so you can run commands and inspect the container.

If you don't specify what the container is supposed to do it will close immediately.

```bash
docker run alpine:3.10

docker run alpine:3.10 ls # run alpine with the ls command

docker run alpine:3.10 ls -al # command at the end is passed into the container

docker run --detach -it ubuntu:bionic # or, to be shorter: docker run -dit ubuntu:bionic

docker ps # view the containers

docker attach <ID or name> # e.g. `docker attach 20919c49d6e5` would attach to that container
```

This allows you to attach a shell to a running container and mess around with it. Useful if you need to inspect something or see running logs.

To kill a container

```bash
docker kill <IDs or names of containers> # e.g. `docker kill fae0f0974d3d 803e1721dad3 20919c49d6e5` would kill those three containers
```
